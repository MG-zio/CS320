# CS320

During this class I learned more about the importance of testing during development and how to properly do it. I utilized unit testing to help me design and test six classes. I kept these tests in mind during development, and even created some of them before I started coding. To form them, I looked at the requirements for each class and molded the tests based on that information. Doing this helped me write code that was alligned with the requirements and removed the possibility of unneeded complexity. 

There were many fundamental aspects to creating quality software that I learned as well. To create secure code, I learned about how to properly handle errors and common security vulnerabilities like not validating input. The techniques taught about how to review code also helped me write better code. First I utilized code reviews myself using my IDE's static testing, and then I used unit tests to ensure that parts of the program were functioning the way I intended. In future projects, I know that I should create integration tests when bringing together different parts of a program. System testing is also important and somethings I hope to be able to implement when working on larger projects in future courses.

Overall, I learned a lot in this course about testing and its usefulness in software development. The focus of this class on continuous improvement of our testing methods has primed me for a future of writing quality and secure code.
